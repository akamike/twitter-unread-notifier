# Twitter Unread Notifier

A userscript for [Fluid.app](http://fluidapp.com/) and [twitter.com](http://twitter.com)

## About

This userscript can be used with your twitter.com instance of Fluid.app (SSB) to update the dock badge with the count of unread tweets. It also displays a growl notification with the unread count every 10 minutes, just in case you don't watch your dock.

This also now functions correctly with #newtwitter.

## Requirements

* [Fluid.app](http://fluidapp.com/)
* A [twitter.com](http://twitter.com) SSB created by Fluid.app.
* Growl

## Install

1. Download 'Twitter Unread Notifier.user.js'.
2. Place the file into your Twitter SSB's userscript folder located at `~/Library/Application Support/Fluid/SSB/<your-ssb-name>/Userscripts`. You can also access this from your Twitter SSB using `Userscripts > Open Userscripts Folder`.
3. In your Twitter SSB, `Userscripts > Reload All Userscripts`, and then `Userscripts > Twitter Unread Notifier`.

And that's it! You may need to reload the page or restart your SSB to ensure it has been installed correctly.
